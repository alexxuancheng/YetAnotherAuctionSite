# YetAnotherAuctionSite-YAAS

YAAS is a web application and a web service to create and participate in auctions. Examples of popular
auction​ ​sites​ ​include​ ​​ebay.com​​ ​and​ ​​huuto.net​.
An auction site is a good example of a service offered as a web application. The organization owning an auction site does not buy or sell anything. Instead, it creates a community of users interested in buying or selling the most diverse items and provides its members with the tools to communicate and interact in​ ​a​ ​convenient,​ ​fast​ ​and​ ​easy​ ​way.
In​ ​the​ ​rest​ ​of​ ​this​ ​section,​ ​we​ ​describe​ ​the​ ​main​ ​requirements​ ​for​ ​the​ ​YAAS​ ​web​ ​application​ ​and​ ​web service.
